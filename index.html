<h1>Project Overview</h1>
<p>Welcome to the client site of Team Xtreme.As Team Xtreme we redesigned the Comp 1950 
    Intermediate Web Development and Design, course website.
    The COMP 1950 owner Alistair Calder would like the web 
    site redesigned in order to better meet the needs of students,
    by working at points, like an online textbook, also the
    instructor would like to improve the accessibility of information 
    on the site while still keeping to the general setup of weekly lectures and notes. 
    Overall, we tried our best to please not only students but 
    the instructor as well, by achieving the goals required.</p>
